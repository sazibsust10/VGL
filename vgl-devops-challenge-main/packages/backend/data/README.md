# Data directory

- `dev.db`: Development SQLite database used by default.
- Keep this file small and anonymized. It is provided to make local startup trivial.
- Candidates may add a MySQL container for development and switch via `.env`.

## Local variants
- You may create local copies, e.g., `dev.local.sqlite`. Consider adding them to `.gitignore`.
