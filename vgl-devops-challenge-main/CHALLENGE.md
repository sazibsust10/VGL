# VGL DevOps Challenge

## Process

- Make any changes to the codebase you deem necessary.  
- Document your work and reasoning in **PLAN.md**.  
- You have **up to three hours** to complete your work. We don’t expect everything to be perfect, we want to see how you think and structure your work.  
- When done, please return your solution as a **single ZIP file** by email.  

## Goals

1. **Deployment-ready**: ensure the applications can be deployed to AWS.  
2. **Local development**: ensure the applications can also run locally in a reproducible way.  
3. **Documentation**: explain what you achieved, what’s missing, and what you would do next if given more time.  
4. **DevOps perspective**: assume the applications have not been maintained with DevOps best practices, make the improvements you consider most important.  
5. **Cost-awareness**: highlight any potential FinOps optimizations or considerations.  

## PLAN.md Guidelines

Please include in your **PLAN.md**:  
1. **Summary of changes** you made and why.  
2. **Assumptions** you had to make.  
3. **Next steps** you’d recommend if you had more time.  
4. Any **risks, cost, or scaling considerations** you want to call out.  

## Company Context

- Code is hosted on GitHub.  
- Production systems are deployed to AWS.  
- The company uses docker, terraform & ansible as part of its stack.  
- Strong focus on Engineering FinOps ownership.  
- Remote-first: developers primarily work on their local machines.  

## Application Context

- The two applications (frontend and backend) were historically deployed separately and manually on physical servers.  
- The platform as a whole has **high traffic**, and growth is expected to continue.
